                            <h2>1.0 Faction Attacks</h2>
                            <p>When you kill or put another member into death mode, attacks are automatically taken into account. Attacks also fall under the following categories:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Turf-Based Attacks</h3>
                            <p>A robbery is considered a faction attack when it occurs on a faction's official turf. (To avoid those who attempt to Play-2-Win and avoid roleplay you do not have to pin-point when robbing an individual within a faction's turf) If the faction member isn't on the set turf, and you are aware that he's apart of the set faction IC, it will not be considered a faction attack. You must have valid reasoning to rob someone as your faction may only rob every 4 hours regardless of the turf, failure to do so will result in punishment.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Hostile Environment Creation</h3>
                            <p>Factions who come to another faction's turf and with the intent to create a hostile environment: visibly aiming your gun (IC), robbing, shooting, stabbing, etc. will be considered a faction attack. Hostile actions can be defined as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Putting someone in the opposing faction in death mode</li>
                                <li>Brawling</li>
                                <li>Chasing an opposing faction on feet or in vehicle</li>
                                <li>Being verbally hostile like dissing their set</li>
                                <li>Spinning 3 or more times (if the faction reacts upon it)</li>
                                <li>Coming to an opposing faction's turf instigating or provoking said faction to attack you (example(s): heavily trooping through an opposing faction's turf you heavily beef with)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Attack Restrictions</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You may not attack a faction that is on probation.</li>
                                <li>If you are attacking and there is less than 4 members outside, you must pinpoint the member your attacking and if you do attack the 4 without pinpointing you must have valid reasoning to believe they are faction members (e.g.: overt disrespect of deceased members or explicit threats to someone's life — for attacks when fewer than four are present you must also roleplay and identify your target in-character (name or alias) and include why you believe they're a faction member. Failure to provide believable, in-character justification risks a faction strike before attacking.</li>
                                <li>When attacking a solo member not on their turf, you must pinpoint the member by having prior beef with that individual / having this player marked. You must identify who the person is by their face or articles of clothing from a previous interaction. Those interactions must be logged before attacking the individual.</li>
                                <li>Fist fights are not considered an attack, unless you outnumber the opposing faction (jumping them) or it results in someone in death mode (Beating someone to death is valid IF you & said faction have 7 negative interactions/screens leading to the event must be roleplayed). After a set faction is Tiered, fights only count towards an interaction.</li>
                                <li>Attacks should be conducted in realistic locations, avoiding heavily populated or surveilled areas. If deemed unrealistic by FM CK will not stick.</li>
                                <li>After every faction attack you are on a 72-hour cooldown with that faction. 12-hour cooldown with other factions.</li>
                                <li>Factions that are on probationary, they aren't able to initiate any attacks during. If another faction attacks you, you have rights to defend.</li>
                                <li>Any negative weapon interaction towards another faction is considered an attack as in upping your gun and pointing it towards someone or robbing someone (if the person is on their turf). Everything must be logged. (flashing your gun in a /me is not an attack.)</li>
                                <li>If the roleplay is sufficient enough and the opposing faction hasn't slid back within 24 hours, you can double attack.</li>
                                <li>Poor Escalation - any type of roleplay that wasn't built up properly or given a sufficient reason to perform a faction attack can lead to a punishment. (e.g. You are not allowed to perform an attack if you are on cooldown, regardless if they heavily provoked you. rule applies to DOUBLE ATTACKING as well.)</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>The maximum number of people you're allowed to bring on an attack is 4 people. (This is excluded if it's on your set turf.)</li>
                                <li>The maximum amount of people you're allowed to bring on a brawl is 10 people per faction. (This includes allies)</li>
                                <li>After every robbery or faction attack you are on a 4 hour (Player) cooldown.</li>
                                <li>You may not linger in the faction's turf as it may be considered turf camping.</li>
                                <li>Attacks must escalate realistically but also organically.</li>
                                <li>Solo attacks are prohibited unless PINPOINTED. (Have fear or roleplay attacking solo)</li>
                                <li>Faction Attacks out of multiple vehicles are allowed, as long as the cars equal the correct amount for a faction attack (4).</li>
